# Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

This is a scheduling tool, meant to show the user where they are at currently in their schedule, what has already happened today, and what they still have scheduled beffore the end of the work day.

While I was building this project I realized that my code is starting to look much cleaner than it has before, and I am very proud of that. The use of local storage along with 3rd party API's in this app has been fun to play around with, and I look forward to doing more projects like this in the future.

## Usage 

When a user opens the link to this app, they are presented with today's date and time, and their schedule for the day. They are able to enter in tasks for each hour of the work day and then save that information to local storage.

When a new day begins, the user's data inputs will be erased on the app so that the user will be able to update the schedule with the new day's tasks.

The coloration of the schedule shows what is yet to be done during the day. Rows in white have already passed, the row for the current hour is shown in red, and the rows for furure hours are shown in green -- as shown here:
